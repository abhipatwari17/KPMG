We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within AWS or Azure or GCP
and provide a json formatted output.
The choice of language and implementation is up to you.
Bonus Points
The code allows for a particular data key to be retrieved individually

soluiton:

To query the metadata of an instance within AWS and provide a JSON formatted output using Ansible playbook, we'll use the Ansible uri module to make an HTTP request to the AWS instance metadata service.

This playbook will make an HTTP request to the AWS instance metadata service, retrieve the response, and display the output in JSON format using the debug module

Additionally, make sure you have Ansible installed on your system and AWS credentials properly configured.

 # On the EC2 instance itself, verify that the instance metadata service is functioning correctly. You can use tools like curl or wget to manually fetch the metadata:
# curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document
